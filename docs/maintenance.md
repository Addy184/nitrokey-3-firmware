# Maintenance Guide

This guide explains how to keep this repository up to date and how to make releases.

## Updating the Repository

### Upstream Changes

Regularly check the [solo2](https://github.com/solokeys/solo2) for relevant changes and merge them into this repository.  Before pushing the merge, make sure to run the build so that the `Cargo.lock` file is updated.  If it changed, add it to the merge commit.

### Dependencies

As we have a `Cargo.lock` file with fixed dependency versions, we donâ€™t automatically pull in new dependency versions.  To update the version of a specific dependency, run `cargo update -p <name>`.  To update all dependencies, run `cargo update`.

## Releasing

### Creating Releases

To release a new version of the firmware, perform the following steps:
1. Update the version counter in `runners/lpc55/Cargo.toml` and `runners/embedded/Cargo.toml`.
2. Run the firmware build for both runners and add the updated `Cargo.lock`.
3. Update the changelog.
4. Commit all changed files and create a signed tag with a `v` prefix and the version number, for example `v1.0.0`.
5. Create a release on GitHub and copy the relevant section from the changelog to the release description.

### Signing Releases (lpc55)

1. Download the `firmware-nk3xn.bin` and `commands.bd` as built by the CI from the release tag.
2. Sign the firmware and build a SB2.1 image using the `commands.bd` file.
3. Upload the SB2.1 image to the GitHub release using the filename pattern `firmware-<device>-<chip>-v<version>.sb2`, for example `firmware-nk3xn-lpc55-v1.0.0.sb2`.
